# What Is Prototyping? A Complete Guide for Product Teams

Prototyping is the process of creating an early model of a product to test ideas, gather feedback, and iterate before investing in full development. For digital products like mobile apps and websites, a prototype is an interactive simulation that demonstrates how the final product will look and function.

## Why Prototyping Matters

Building software is expensive. A single mobile app can cost anywhere from $50,000 to $500,000+ to develop. Prototyping helps teams:

- **Validate ideas early** before committing engineering resources
- **Communicate vision** to stakeholders, investors, and developers
- **Identify usability issues** before they become costly to fix
- **Align teams** around a shared understanding of the product

Research shows that fixing a bug after development is 6x more expensive than catching it during the design phase. Prototyping is your first line of defense.

## Types of Prototypes

### Low-Fidelity Prototypes

Simple sketches or wireframes that focus on layout and flow rather than visual design. Great for:
- Early brainstorming sessions
- Quick iteration on concepts
- Stakeholder alignment on structure

### High-Fidelity Prototypes

Polished, realistic representations that look like the final product. Used for:
- User testing and feedback
- Investor presentations
- Developer handoff
- Marketing materials

### Interactive Prototypes

Clickable prototypes with working navigation between screens. Essential for:
- Testing user flows
- Validating information architecture
- Demonstrating functionality to stakeholders

## Prototyping in the Product Development Process

### 1. Discovery Phase
Start with low-fidelity sketches to explore multiple directions. Don't get attached to any single idea yet.

### 2. Definition Phase
Create wireframes that define the structure and flow. Focus on user journeys and information hierarchy.

### 3. Design Phase
Develop high-fidelity prototypes with real visual design. This is where your product starts to feel real.

### 4. Validation Phase
Test your prototype with real users. Gather feedback, identify pain points, and iterate.

### 5. Handoff Phase
Use your validated prototype as the source of truth for development.

## Who Uses Prototypes?

### Designers
- Explore visual directions
- Test interaction patterns
- Present design concepts

### Product Managers
- Validate feature ideas
- Communicate requirements
- Get stakeholder buy-in

### Founders & Entrepreneurs
- Pitch to investors
- Test market demand
- Recruit early users

### Developers
- Understand expected behavior
- Identify technical constraints early
- Estimate implementation effort

## Modern Prototyping Tools

The prototyping landscape has evolved dramatically. Traditional tools like Sketch and Figma require design skills. Newer AI-powered tools like OpenDesign let anyone create professional prototypes just by describing what they want.

| Tool Type | Examples | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Traditional | Figma, Sketch | Professional designers |
| No-code | Framer, Webflow | Design-savvy builders |
| AI-powered | OpenDesign | Anyone with an idea |

## Getting Started with Prototyping

1. **Start with the user problem** - What are you solving?
2. **Map the user journey** - What steps do users take?
3. **Sketch rough ideas** - Don't aim for perfection
4. **Create an interactive flow** - Make it clickable
5. **Test with real users** - Get feedback early
6. **Iterate based on learnings** - Refine and repeat

## The Future of Prototyping

AI is transforming how we create prototypes. Instead of spending hours in design tools, teams can now describe their ideas in plain language and get working prototypes in seconds. This democratizes design and accelerates innovation.

Tools like OpenDesign generate complete, interactive prototypes from text descriptions. You can iterate through conversation, making changes as naturally as talking to a colleague.
